Yes, it's easier to setup but it means that with every post you make you will promote that plugin author to all your friends and followers. All those posts will be marked as \"Shared via Wordpress.com\" or \"posted by Linksalpha\". SNAP gives you an ability to setup your own apps and promote only yourself. We have a very detailed and illustrated setup instructions and our support can help you with that. We believe that it's well worth to spend your time by setting it up, instead of doing free advertisement for somebody else."
